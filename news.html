            <p class="words">(CNN)On the night Vice President-elect Kamala Harris made history, she recognized the long battle women had faced for the right to vote and to break into the highest ranks of American politics -- and said that "every little girl watching" across the country now knows they can do so, too.</p>
            <p class="words">In a speech Saturday night in Wilmington, Delaware, before she introduced President-elect Joe Biden, Harris also thanked Black women, saying they are "too often overlooked, but so often prove that they are the backbone of our democracy."</p>

        <div class="item2">
            <p class="words1">"While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last," Harris said. "Because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities."</p>
            <p class="words1">"And to the children of our country, regardless of your gender, our country has sent you a clear message: Dream with ambition, lead with conviction and see yourself in a way that others might not see you, simply because they've never seen it before. And we will applaud you every step of the way," she said.</p>
            <p class="words1">A history-making figure as the first woman, the first Black person and the first South Asian elected vice president, Harris began her speech with a nod to Georgia Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights icon who died this year.</p>
            <p class="words1">Harris was the fourth woman to appear on a major political party's presidential ticket, following Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro in 1984, Republican No. 2 Sarah Palin in 2008 and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016. She is the first to win.</p>

            <p class="words1">"When she came here when was 19, she could not have imagined this moment," Harris said of her mother, who died in 2009. "But she believed in an America where moments like this are possible."</p><br>
